Object Removal Or Decluttering: 


object removal is one of the most widely used image editing technique in real estate. The process involves several techniques that will selectively remove any objects in the photograph that can cause an obstruction in the image. In real estate, the images must be well portrayed free of any disturbances that usually occur in the natural world such as trees, electric poles, and cars parked in front. Such a clean image is required for presenting the images to the web as customers often find such elements distracting from the original object portrayed in the image, which is the home or building.Clutter can be easily defined as too much stuff in a confined amount of space whereas digital decluttering is the process of deciding what to remove and what to keep. Almost all digital images contain unnecessary objects in their background and these objects may ruin the beauty of the entire image. In certain cases, the unnecessary objects in the background of your images may also make your real estate property look bad to viewers, which is not a good thing for your business.
